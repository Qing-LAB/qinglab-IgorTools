General information

The LIH_XOP is an Igor external operation (XOP) that adds functions
for controlling the HEKA LIH 8+8 and LIH 1600 or Instrutech's ITC-16 
and ITC-18 AD/DA converters from an Igor procedure or from Igor's 
command line.

It uses the Windows dynamic link library "EPCdll.dll" and therefore 
only works on Windows computers. This version of LIH_6XOP requires 
Igor Pro 6.2 or later.


Installation

The LIH 1600, ITC-16 or ITC-18 driver has to be installed. The driver 
files can found in the "lih_driver" folder or it can be downloaded from
our web site at www.heka.com.

Extract all files from the LIH_XOP archive to any folder on the hard disk 
of your computer. Make a shortcut from the lih_xop-64.xop file and drag the
shortcut into the “Igor Extensions (64-bit)” folder whch you can find in 
your “Igor Pro User Files” folder. Do the same for the lih_xop.ihf.
Finally move the EpcDll.dll file and the 
LIH88Driver.dll to the lih_xop-64 folder (the folder where the lih_xop-64.xop (not the shortcut!)
file is stored). 

Important note: IGOR64 loads only XOPs whose names end with "64" (e.g., lih_xop-64.xop).
So, we strongly recommend not to rename the .xop file. (IGOR32 loads only 
XOPs whose names do not end with "64" ).


Start Igor and choose "Command Help" from the Help menu. Select "External"
from the Functions popup menu above the list and uncheck the Operations
and Programming checkboxes. Find the new "LIH_..." functions in the list.
The custom help for these external function is shown.



Examples

We provide example experiment files for demonstrating the capabilties of
the LIH functions. Load one of these experiments from the "Examples" folder, 
initialize the LIH 8+8 and start stimulation and data acquisition. If you
should use LIH 1600, ITC-16 or ITC-18 interface, then you will have to change
the "Board" parameter of the LIH_InitInterface function.
