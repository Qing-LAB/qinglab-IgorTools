General information

The LIH_XOP is an Igor external operation (XOP) that adds functions
for controlling the HEKA LIH 8+8 and LIH 1600 or Instrutech's ITC-16 
and ITC-18 AD/DA converters from an Igor procedure or from Igor's 
command line.

It uses the Windows dynamic link library "EPCdll.dll" and therefore 
only works on Windows computers. This version of LIH_XOP requires 
Igor Pro 5.0 or later.


Installation

For LIH 1600, ITC-16 or ITC-18 interfaces a driver needs to be installed.
The driver files can found in the "heka_driver" folder or they can be 
downloaded from our web site at www.heka.com.

Extract all files from the LIH_XOP archive to any folder on the hard disk 
of your computer. Make a shortcut from the lih_xop.xop file and drag the
shortcut into your Igor Extensions folder. Do the same for the lih_xop.ihf.
Finally move the EpcDll.dll file, and the LIH88Driver.dll to the Igor program
folder (the folder where the Igor.exe file is stored).

Start Igor and choose "Command Help" from the Help menu. Select "External"
from the Functions popup menu above the list and uncheck the Operations
and Programming checkboxes. Find the new "LIH_..." functions in the list.
The custom help for these external function is shown.



Examples

We provide example experiment files for demonstrating the capabilties of
the LIH functions. Load one of these experiments from the "Examples" folder, 
initialize the LIH 8+8 and start stimulation and data acquisition. If you
should use LIH 1600, ITC-16 or ITC-18 interface, then you will have to change
the "Board" parameter of the LIH_InitInterface function.
